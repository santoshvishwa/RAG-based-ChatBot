# 🗃️ Talk2YourData 

**Talk2YourData** is an **intelligent document assistant** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).  
It allows users to upload their **Own documents (PDF)** and interact with them through a chat interface.  

The application uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to retrieve relevant information from uploaded documents and generate accurate, context-aware answers.

## ✨ Core Features

- 📂 **Document Upload**  
  Upload one or more PDF files through a simple web interface.  

- 📝 **Text Extraction & Processing**  
  Extract text from PDFs, split into manageable chunks, and convert into numerical **vector embeddings**.  

- 📦 **Vector Storage**  
  Store embeddings in a **FAISS vector database** for efficient similarity searching.  

- 💬 **Chat Interface**  
  Ask questions in a user-friendly chat interface.  

- 🤖 **Retrieval & Generation**  
  Relevant chunks are retrieved and passed to a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to generate context-aware answers.
